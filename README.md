**Heart Diseases Medical Terminology Search Engine**

This project is a web application that uses Apache Nutch as a web crawler, Flask as the framework, and NLP techniques for data preprocessing and extraction. It integrates the SNOMED API for retrieving related medical terminologies.

**Why users need Medical Terminology Search Engine?**

â€¢ Detailing medical term with related terms and description all
together.

â€¢ Providing accurate, reliable information from trusted sources.

â€¢ Connecting related information for better understanding

**Features:**

â€¢ Web Crawling: Powered by Apache Nutch for data collection from web sources.

â€¢ Natural Language Processing: Uses scikit-learn for text preprocessing and similarity analysis.

â€¢ API Integration: Retrieves SNOMED CT descriptions via the SNOMED API.

â€¢ Flask Framework: Handles the back-end application and API routes.
